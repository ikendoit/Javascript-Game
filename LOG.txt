22:10 Wed Create system : Object Orientation, 2 classes Pet + Food, set draw() and update(), set canvas. 

14:49 Thu changed vector system.


Problems:

    1.  Collision : 

      **Problems:

        -   when the cursor move, even if 100px away from the pet, we still lose HP.
        -   when the cursor is at special diagonal positions to the pet, we still lost HP

      **Solution:

        -   update cursor position whenever checking for pet.caught()
		-	updated Algorithm for hit detection, now everything works
